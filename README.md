# Who Am I
 Hello, I am @lupusinferni315,
 I am a freelance programmer with a passion for procedural generation,
 and I am working on starting a game development company "Stellar Wolf Entertainment".
 I like experimenting with procedural generation and learning more about how "entropy" in a digital system works.
 I am currently trying to learn how to program in c++
 
 # Why Procedural Generation
 I found a passion for procedural generation a long time ago and have always wanted to learn more,
 honestly I don't know why I am ~~interested in~~ obsessed with not just what you can do with it but in how it actually
 works.
