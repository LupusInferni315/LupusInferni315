# Raistlin Wolfe — Lupus Inferni

**Mildly feral game developer, engine tinkerer, and chaos enthusiast**

Forged in flame and fueled by caffeine, I build worlds, break them, and—on particularly cursed days—summon digital horrors no mortal compiler should witness.

## About Me

- Founder & lead developer at **Stellar Wolf Entertainment**
- Designer, programmer, and occasional wielder of forbidden code
- Advocate for systems that behave… and creatures that absolutely do not

## What I Create

- **Aurora Game Engine** — my ever‑evolving sandbox of tech and torment
- Simulation & strategy games with depth, personality, and sharp edges
- Utility libraries for devs who like their tools fast and reliable
- Experimental side projects that may or may not bite
