# Raistlin Wolfe — Lupus Inferni

**Mildly feral game developer, engine tinkerer, and chaos enthusiast**

Forged in flame and fueled by caffeine, I build worlds, break them, and—on particularly cursed days—summon digital horrors no mortal compiler should witness.

## About Me

I’m Raistlin, a developer based in Mirror, Alberta. This repository is my personal workshop, laboratory, and digital dumping ground for whatever I’m experimenting with outside of professional work. Expect a shifting mix of prototypes, half‑formed ideas, utilities, engine experiments, and the occasional questionable creation that probably shouldn’t exist but does anyway.

I’m drawn to software development, systems tinkering, and understanding how things work beneath the surface. This space is where I test new approaches, document odd discoveries, and keep notes that don’t fit neatly into my business projects.

Everything here evolves as I do, so the contents change depending on what I’m learning, breaking, or rebuilding at any given moment.

## Primary Languages

- C
- C++
- C#
- ASM

(Also familiar with far too many other languages, toolchains, and experimental ecosystems to even list.)
